# Can You Draw?

**Version 1.0.0**

During the first week of development much browsing was done op the internet of what tool or game would be created.
Eventually it came down to what artist I truly am, which is a pen and paper artist. However, I wanted to make this done
different and unique. Something that is personal to me yet something everyone can do. I wanted to add what I favor in as an artist
along with what I learned to do within ART 101. The following week I had decided to use a randomizer within the frame on the play section
of my game and have it be a reference that the played would then use to redraw within a canvas space as a timer goes off. The idea is for the user to
recreate the drawing to the best of their ability, and then the game analyzes whether or not the user can draw or not. This is a simple yet very user friendly
game that is being created. Inspiration was taken from tools, such as Microsoft paint, Windows Pad, and then games like Gartic Phone/Skibblio.
